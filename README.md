# cxxpool

cxxpool is a header-only thread pool for C++. It enables you to schedule independent
tasks with or without specifying task priorities. Pushing a task into the thread
pool returns a future associated to the underlying execution. 

cxxpool is designed for ease of use, portability, and scalability. It is written in 
C++11 and only depends on the standard library. Just copy `src/cxxpool.h` 
to your project and off you go!
